The two files in this folder, Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h, are those from the original implementation of this build.  You can replace the default Marlin config files with these as a good starting point.  These include important details about temperature sensors (or the lack thereof) and end stops. Further tweaks can be made if desired to tune specifically for your project.
